The **Battery Discharge Controller** is a revolutionary solution designed for effectively managing the discharge of Li-Ion and LiPo batteries to a user-defined voltage level. This board boasts a compact design, modularity, and the ability to rapidly discharge batteries with a custom load of up to 15A. It finds its primary application in the field of model building, where it serves to extend battery lifespan by quickly discharging batteries that have been accidentally charged and left unused for several days. This is a game-changer, considering that most battery chargers can only discharge batteries slowly.

## Key Features

- **Compact Design:** The Battery Discharge Controller is designed with a small footprint, making it suitable for various projects where space is limited.

- **Modularity:** Its modular architecture allows for seamless integration into a wide range of applications, providing flexibility for different use cases.

- **Custom Load:** Users can set their desired discharge load, enabling them to tailor the discharging process to specific battery types and capacities.

- **Battery Lifespan Enhancement:** By preventing overcharging and facilitating controlled discharging, this controller significantly improves the longevity of rechargeable batteries.

- **Mobile App Integration:** All data and settings can be conveniently accessed and managed through a mobile app, enhancing user convenience.

## Upcoming Features

In our continuous effort to enhance the Battery Discharge Controller, we are actively working on the following features, which will be available soon:

- **Precise Discharge to Set Voltage:** We are developing a feature that allows for even more precise discharge control to the user-set voltage, ensuring utmost accuracy in battery management.

- **WiFi Firmware Updates:** Soon, you'll be able to easily update the controller's firmware over a WiFi connection, ensuring that you always have the latest features and improvements.

- **Battery Discharge History:** The upcoming software update will enable users to view a log of discharged batteries, providing insights into the performance and usage history.

- **Expanded Display Menu:** We are adding an additional menu page to the controller's display, allowing users to make settings adjustments directly on the device or via the mobile app for added convenience.

## Mobile App

Our mobile app allows users to:

- Monitor battery discharge progress in real-time.
- Adjust discharge settings remotely.
- Access historical data and trends for discharged batteries.
- Receive notifications and alerts when the discharging process is complete.

## Availability

Please note that this project is still in its early stages of development. We are actively working on bringing it to market, and it will be available for purchase soon. Stay tuned for updates on availability and ordering information.
